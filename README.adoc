== Introduction

This is a very small, yet surprisingly complete, example of using Clojure to
serve up a RESTful API and to provide a user interface using Thymeleaf and
HTMX. It uses a variety of technologies to demonstrate how this is possible.
The project offers a full API CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete)
experience over some Star Trek starships!

== Features

* API CRUD Functionality
* Login and view for the UI (Delete and Create/Update coming soon!)
* Exception Handling (both RESTful and for the UI)
* Internationalisation (i18n)
* Swagger API
* Input Validation (using https://github.com/metosin/malli[Malli])
* https://www.thymeleaf.org[Thymeleaf] to render webpages
* https://htmx.org[HTMX] to provide user interaction via the UI.

=== Star Trek

This backend is written in Clojure and uses a PostgreSQL database to store a
list of starships. The technologies in play include:

* https://github.com/metosin/reitit[reitit]
* https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc[next-jdbc]
* https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql[honeysql]
* https://github.com/donut-power/system[donut.system]
* https://github.com/juxt/aero[juxt aero]
* https://github.com/flyway/flyway[flyway database migration]
* https://babashka.org/[babashka (for some gentle scripting)]

The frontend is rendered using:

* https://www.thymeleaf.org/[thymeleaf]
* https://www.htmx.org[htmx]

*Additionally:*

* https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/reitit/0.5.18/doc/advanced/dev-workflow[Uses a dynamic (repl-friendly) reitit dev workflow]
* Also includes tests (including transactional rollbacks per test)!

A full list of the technologies that are used can be found in the `deps.edn`
file.

This service also exposes
https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/[Prometheus] metrics *AND* a
JMX endpoint for your enjoyment!

=== Engage!

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you want to use the supplied `Justfile`, you'll need to have
https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/justfile[just] installed.
====

There are at least 3 ways to launch this project:

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need to have the database and cache services running first (in
a separate terminal). The command to do this, if you have `just` installed is
`just up`, or if you don't have `just` installed, you can do

* `docker compose -f scripts/docker/docker-compose-services.yml up`
====

Now, then for the first option:

==== Option 1

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need to copy the `resources/config/config-example.edn` to
`resources/config/config-local.edn` and modify, for example, if you are
connecting to your own PostgreSQL instance.
====

Fire up your repl using:

* `clj -M:dev`

to load up the `dev` alias defined in the `deps.edn` then

* `(require 'dev)`
* `(dev/go)`

to start the system.

==== Option 2

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need to copy the `resources/config/config-example.edn` to
`resources/config/config-local.edn` and modify, for example, if you are
connecting to your own PostgreSQL instance.
====

* `just run-local`

or

* `bin/build`
* `bin/run-local`

==== Option 3

[IMPORTANT]
====
You don't need to copy any config file, as the docker container is configured
to use `config/config-example.edn`, and thus this is the one by the
application.
====

* `just run-docker`

or

* `bin/build`
* `bin/imagify`
* `bin/run-docker`

== Interrogating the API

Once the service is up and running (and listening by default on port 8080),
there are a few examples of interrogating the API to pull back some data. The
scripts can be found in `scripts/bb`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You will need https://babashka.org/[Babashka] installed.
====

To run a script just execute them on the command line, i.e.,
`./find-all-starships.clj`

If you have https://github.com/borkdude/jet[jet] installed, you can convert
the EDN response to JSON like so:

`./find-all-starships.clj | jet -o json`

== Logging in via the UI

Open up a browser and visit `http://localhost:8080/` From that page, click on
the `login` link. The username and password has been pre-filled in for you.

== License

Find the full https://unlicense.org/[unlicense] in the `UNLICENSE` (and
`LICENSE`) file, but here's a snippet:

```

== Feedback

I welcome feedback. I can usually be found hanging out in the `#clojure-uk` or
`#clojure-europe` channels on https://clojurians.slack.com[Clojurians] Slack.
You can also email me if you wish :-)

== Finally!

*Live Long and Prosper!*
